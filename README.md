DEEP VIRTUAL TWO PION PAIR PRODUCTION

 This is a phase-space model of $ep \rightarrow e^{\prime} p^{\prime} \pi_{1} \pi_{2}$.
 
 Here we have 8 independent kinematic variables in the final state of  $ep \rightarrow e^{\prime} p^{\prime} \pi_{1} \pi_{2}$. 
 
 Those are $Q^{2}$, $x_{B}$, $\phi_{e}$, $M_{1,2}^{2}$, $t$, $\phi_{1,2}^{*}$, $cos(\theta)_{\sigma_{rest}}$, $\phi_{\sigma_{rest}}$.
 This event generator has proceeded as follows.(with fixed incident beam energy $k=10.6 GeV$
